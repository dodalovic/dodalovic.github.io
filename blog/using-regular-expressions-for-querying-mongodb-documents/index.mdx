title: Using regular expressions for querying Mongodb documents

Ladies and gents, here’s one fairly short hint for anyone wondering how to query documents in `Mongodb`
using regular expressions. Let’s get straight to the point:

<!--truncate-->

Let’s start by inserting couple of documents (using `Mongodb` shell) which we’ll use for querying
afterwards:

```javascript
db.developers.insertMany([
  { name: "John", languages: ["java", "php", "javascript"] },
  { name: "Johnny", languages: ["java", "c", "c++"] },
  { name: "Jim", languages: ["node", "java"] }
]);
```

Now, when we run the following command in shell:

```javascript
db.developers.find();
```

Command output confirms all test documents are successfully stored:

```json
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("587e6ec738cbd11c2dc46932"),
    "name" : "John",
    "languages" : [
        "java",
        "php",
        "javascript"
    ]
}
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("587e6ec738cbd11c2dc46933"),
    "name" : "Johnny",
    "languages" : [
        "java",
        "c",
        "c++"
    ]
}
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("587e6ec738cbd11c2dc46934"),
    "name" : "Jim",
    "languages" : [
        "node",
        "java"
    ]
}
```

Now, say you want to find all documents that have field name starting with some particular value,
let’s say "Joh". The way to do is pretty straightforward:

```javascript
db.developers.find({ name: { $regex: /^Joh.*/ } }).pretty();
```

Command output confirms we matched correct document(s):

```json
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("587e6ec738cbd11c2dc46932"),
    "name" : "John",
    "languages" : [
        "java",
        "php",
        "javascript"
    ]
}
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("587e6ec738cbd11c2dc46933"),
    "name" : "Johnny",
    "languages" : [
        "java",
        "c",
        "c++"
    ]
}
```

We could also try matching documents having some field ending with particular value, let’s say
"im", just by doing something like:

```javascript
db.developers.find({ name: { $regex: /^.*im$/ } }).pretty();
```

which would match "Jim" in our case:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("587e6ec738cbd11c2dc46934"),
  "name": "Jim",
  "languages": ["node", "java"]
}
```

Regular expressions are sometimes the only way to go for particular problem sets, so I hope this
helps to understand mongodb `API`s dealing with regular expressions.

That was all for today! Hope you liked it!
