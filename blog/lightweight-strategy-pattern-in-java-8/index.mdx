In computer programming, the **strategy pattern** (also known as the **policy pattern**) is a software design pattern that enables an
algorithm's behavior **to be selected at runtime**. The strategy pattern. defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm,
and. makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

Let's start straight away with an example. The task is to build an application that would load a user information from arbitrary storage,
log user details using arbitrary logger and finally - save user using different persistence options. The application should be a `Java` console
application receiving input from the command line.

Say we have a main class:

```java
package rs.dodalovic.design_patterns.behavioral.strategy.user_persistence;

import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.function.Consumer;
import java.util.function.Function;

public class UserPersistMain {

    private static final Map<String, Function<Integer, User>> userProviderMapping = ImmutableMap.of(
            "fs-provider", UserProviders.FILE_SYSTEM,
            "web-service-provider", UserProviders.WEB_SERVICE
    );

    private static final Map<String, Consumer> userPersisterMapping = ImmutableMap.of(
            "mongo-persister", UserPersisters.MONGO,
            "mysql-persister", UserPersisters.MYSQL
    );

    private static final Map<String, Consumer> userLoggerMapping = ImmutableMap.of(
            "console-logger", UserLoggers.CONSOLE,
            "sentry-logger", UserLoggers.SENTRY
    );

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int userId = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        final Function<Integer, User> userProvider = userProviderMapping.get(args[1]);
        final Consumer userPersister = userPersisterMapping.get(args[2]);
        final Consumer userLogger = args.length == 4 ? userLoggerMapping.get(args[3]) : UserLoggers.CONSOLE;

        new UserPersistenceDirector(userId, userProvider, userPersister, userLogger).persist();
    }
}
```

The first argument passed from command line is `userId`. The second one is `userProvider`, the next one is `userPersister`, and
finally, let's say we can optionally pass `userLogger` (in case we don't provide it via command line input, we default to console
logging).

We have provided mappings from command line parameter names to different implementations (strategies) as static maps:
`userProviderMapping`, `userPersisterMapping`, `userLoggerMapping`. Depending on values passed from command line, we will choose
appropriate implementation at program runtime.

Strategies implementations are encapsulated withing separate interfaces.

`UserProviders` contains implementations of various strategies
for loading user details. `UserPersisters` interface contains implementations of different strategies that are taking care of
persisting user details. `UserLoggers` contains different strategies for logging user details.

These strategies are quite lightweight, since we're using `Java 8` concepts of functional interfaces that come handy in our case.
Given below are our interfaces containing strategies:

```java
package rs.dodalovic.design_patterns.behavioral.strategy.user_persistence;
import java.util.function.Function;

interface UserProviders {
    Function<Integer, User> FILE_SYSTEM = userId -> {
        System.out.println("Retrieving user data from file system...");
        return new User(userId, "Mike", "United States");
    };
    Function<Integer, User> WEB_SERVICE = userId -> {
        System.out.println("Retrieving user data from web service...");
        return new User(userId, "Jane", "Canada");
    };
}
```

```java
package rs.dodalovic.design_patterns.behavioral.strategy.user_persistence;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

interface UserPersisters {
    Consumer MONGO = user -> System.out.format("Persisting user [%s] to Mongo DB...%n", user.toString());
    Consumer MYSQL = user -> System.out.format("Persisting user [%s] to MySQL DB...%n", user.toString());
}
```

```java
package rs.dodalovic.design_patterns.behavioral.strategy.user_persistence;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

interface UserLoggers {
    Consumer CONSOLE = user -> System.out.format("Logging user [%s] to console...%n", user.toString());
    Consumer SENTRY = user -> System.out.format("Logging user [%s] to sentry...%n", user.toString());
}
```

Also, we have a simple `Java Bean`:

```java
package rs.dodalovic.design_patterns.behavioral.strategy.user_persistence;

class User {
    private final int id;
    private final String username;
    private final String location;

    public User(int id, String username, String location) {
        this.id = id;
        this.username = username;
        this.location = location;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("User{id=%d, username='%s', location='%s'}", id, username, location);
    }
}
```

Important class in our case is `UserPersistenceDirector` which takes care of entire process: loading, logging and finally - persisting
user. It's quite lightweight, since it just delegates persisting process steps to strategies we provide at runtime. Let's see the
implementation:

```java
package rs.dodalovic.design_patterns.behavioral.strategy.user_persistence;

import java.util.function.Consumer;
import java.util.function.Function;

class UserPersistenceDirector {

    private final int userId;
    private final Function<Integer, User> userProvider;
    private final Consumer userPersister;
    private Consumer userLogger;

    public UserPersistenceDirector(int userId, Function<Integer, User> userProvider, Consumer userPersister) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.userProvider = userProvider;
        this.userPersister = userPersister;
    }

    public UserPersistenceDirector(int userId, Function<Integer, User> userProvider, Consumer userPersister,
                                   Consumer userLogger) {
        this(userId, userProvider, userPersister);
        this.userLogger = userLogger;
    }

    public void persist() {
        final User user = userProvider.apply(userId);
        userLogger.accept(user);
        userPersister.accept(user);
    }
}
```

We can see that it has constructors receiving strategies. We inject strategies at runtime, depending on input parameters. We store
strategies as instance fields.

`UserPersistenceDirector` has a `public` method `persist()` , which coordinates high level persistence mechanism. We can see in it's
implementation that all it does is delegating job to strategies that were given to it. So, this is a high level component that defines
process and it's steps, and we can completely vary algorithm passing different strategies at runtime. So, client of `UserPersistenceDirector`
has complete control of picking the strategies it wants executed.

Advantage of using `Java 8` is that it ships with functional interfaces, such as `Consumer<T>`, `Function<T,R>` which we can use for
defining strategies and we can use elegant `lambda` syntax to provide strategies implementations.

> Whenever we want the ability to execute some high level process that has well established steps, but we want to be able
> to control & vary implementation of these steps - `Strategy pattern` comes handy.

We can execute our application giving sample input parameters. If we want to pass `userId:1` , user provider as `fs-provider`,
user persister as `mongo-persister`, and user logger as  `sentry-logger`, we can execute:

```bash
java rs.dodalovic.design_patterns.behavioral.strategy.user_persistence.UserPersistMain 1 fs-provider mongo-persister sentry-logger
Output:
Retrieving user data from file system...
Logging user [User{id=1, username='Mike', location='United States'}] to sentry...
Persisting user [User{id=1, username='Mike', location='United States'}] to Mongo DB...
```
