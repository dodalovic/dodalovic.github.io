_Kotlin_ language recently gained some traction owing to _Google_ promoting it as a primary language for
writing android apps. _Kotlin_ has already been for a while in production owing to it’s creator _JetBrains_
incorporating it in own tools, such as _Intellij IDEA_ and so forth.

One, amongst many other neat features, is extension functions. In depth documentation can be found on official
kotlin [website](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html).

## About extension functions

In short – extension functions provide us useful tool to extend any existing class, no matter if it’s part of JDK,
some 3rd party library or even own, custom ones.

Example, taken from this project, is the following one:

```kotlin
fun Random.betweenInclusive(lower: Int, upper: Int) = this.nextInt(upper - lower) + lower
```

Here we extend `java.util.Random` class from the `JDK`, with `betweenInclusive(lower: Int, upper: Int)`
extension function. This method helps us generate random integer between two numbers, lower and upper
bounds, inclusive. Project contains couple of useful extension functions, implemented in
`rs/dodalovic/extension_functions/Students.kt` kotlin file. Other examples are extending `java.util.List` with
additional capabilities, taking advantage of functional programming applied on collections.

## Running sample application

Application has [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool packaged inside application, so you’re good to go:

```console

# execute from project root

./gradlew -q -PmainClass=rs.dodalovic.extension_functions.StudentsKt execute
```

Output would be similar to:

```console

\***\* Students average: 3.22 \*\***

Above average:

,

,
{'name':'name_2','lastname':'lastname_2','average':'3.2','marks':'[1, 5, 2, 5, 3]'}

,
{'name':'name_8','lastname':'lastname_8','average':'3.2','marks':'[4, 3, 4, 4, 1]'}
,
{'name':'name_9','lastname':'lastname_9','average':'3.2','marks':'[1, 4, 5, 5, 1]'}
,
{'name':'name_10','lastname':'lastname_10','average':'2.8','marks':'[5, 5, 1, 2, 1]'}
]

Highest mark:
5

Best student:

{'name':'name_5','lastname':'lastname_5','average':'4.4','marks':'[5, 5, 4, 4, 4]'}
```

## Calling extensions on null references

It is even possible to call extension on a `null` reference. In extension implementation, we
can, using `this` keyword, check if reference was `null` or not, and perform any logic based
upon that.

Here's an example:

```kotlin
fun <T> T?.nullSafeToString(): String {
  return this?.toString() ?: "NULL"
}

fun main() {
  println(null.nullSafeToString())
  println("Kotlin".nullSafeToString())
}
```

That was all for today! Hope you liked it!
