title: Sending mail via GMail using Kotlin and commons-mail library

Continuing series of blog posts related to `Kotlin`, today we’ll together make a sample application showing us how we could automate
email sending – using `Kotlin` programming language. Example is quite simple, and surely – you can enhance it with own features. Application
mostly demonstrates compact `Kotlin` syntax, as well as full compatibility with Java or 3rd party libraries (in this case Apache `commons-mail` library).

<!--truncate-->

Let’s first take a look at our script (`scripts/mail/MailSender.kt`):

```kotlin
package mail

import org.apache.commons.mail.DefaultAuthenticator
import org.apache.commons.mail.HtmlEmail
import java.net.URL

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val senderEmail = args[0]
    val password = args[1]
    val toMail = args[2]

    val email = HtmlEmail()
    email.hostName = "smtp.googlemail.com"
    email.setSmtpPort(465)
    email.setAuthenticator(DefaultAuthenticator(senderEmail, password))
    email.isSSLOnConnect = true
    email.setFrom(senderEmail)
    email.addTo(toMail)
    email.subject = "Test email with inline image sent using Kotlin"
    val kotlinLogoURL = URL("https://kotlinlang.org/assets/images/twitter-card/kotlin_800x320.png")
    val cid = email.embed(kotlinLogoURL, "Kotlin logo")
    email.setHtmlMsg("<html><h1>Kotlin logo</h1><img src=\"cid:$cid\"></html>")
    email.send()
}
```

## Application input

There are three input parameters required:

- your `GMail` address
- your `GMail` password
- recipient's email address

## Application dependencies

Application requires having 3 libs on your classpath. You can either use build tool to help you automate that, or, in case you don’t
want to depend on that – just download the libs listed below, and put them in lib directory.

- `activation-1.1.1.jar`
- `commons-email-1.4.jar`
- `javax.mail-1.5.2.jar`

## Application layout

Application requires the following filesystem structure:

```bash
- project-root
  - scripts
    - mail
      - MailSender.kt
  - lib
    - activation-1.1.1.jar
    - commons-email-1.4.jar
    - javax.mail-1.5.2.jar
```

## Compiling application (run from project root)

```bash
kotlinc \
 -cp lib/activation-1.1.1.jar:lib/commons-email-1.4.jar:lib/javax.mail-1.5.2.jar \
 scripts/mail/MailSender.kt -include-runtime -d mailSender.jar
```

## Running application (run from project root)

```bash
java -cp "mailSender.jar:lib/\*" \
 mail.MailSenderKt \
 <YOUR-GMAIL-ADDRESS-HERE> <YOUR-GMAIL-PASSWORD-HERE> <RECIPIENT-MAIL-HERE>
```

In case you have enabled two factor authentication using your `GMail` account, you need to create application password here and use that as
a password in command above.

Mail contain header and logo will be delivered to mail recipient you passed to java command above

That was all for today! Hope you liked it!
