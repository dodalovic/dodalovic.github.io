If you feel curious how would an implementation of decorator design pattern look like in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/),
this might be the right place for you. This example is just a very basic thing that you then tweak until
it’s perfect. Pattern definition can be found at [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern), but what’s
important is that you can compose chain of decorators at runtime and in such a way – you can control runtime
behavior of your system.

```kotlin
package patterns

interface CarService {
    fun doService()
}

interface CarServiceDecorator : CarService

class BasicCarService : CarService {
    override fun doService() = println("Doing basic checkup ... DONE")
}

class CarWash(private val carService: CarService) : CarServiceDecorator {
    override fun doService() {
        carService.doService()
        println("Washing car ... DONE")
    }
}

class InsideCarCleanup(private val carService: CarService) : CarServiceDecorator {
    override fun doService() {
        carService.doService()
        println("Cleaning car inside ... DONE")
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val carService = InsideCarCleanup(CarWash(BasicCarService()))
    carService.doService()
}
```

Program output:

```bash
Doing basic checkup ... DONE
Washing car ... DONE
Cleaning car inside ... DONE
```

That was all for today! Hope you liked it!
